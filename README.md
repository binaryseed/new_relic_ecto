# New Relic Ecto

[![Hex.pm Version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/new_relic_ecto.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/new_relic_ecto)

This package will be a lightweight adapter that sends `Ecto` instrumentation data to New Relic.

The long term goal of this package is to align with the [`Telemetry`](https://github.com/elixir-telemetry/telemetry) project.
